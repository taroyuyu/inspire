	<h1>To be done</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>It would be very useful to be able to have subdirectories.  Moreover, it would be nice that the papers I'm copying into these folders in spires, would also be copied into the corresponding directory on disk.  This way one can manipulate/search for papers also outside spires.  (So uploaded papers are either in the main chosen directory or in its subdirs).</li>
		<li>Finding a specific author is sometimes difficult.  In the web-spires I get that list of authors from which I can choose only the relevant ones.  Can we have the same here?</li>
		<li>Since you say that after 10000 entries, the database becomes very slow, maybe one should have the option to erase some of the entries, so as to keep it working efficiently.</li>
		<li>More control over QuickLook. E.g. it only opens PDF with the system default PDF viewer, it doesn't refresh the file when a new version is downloaded. (It would be hard to implement because QuickLook is a system service over which I don't have much control.)</li>
		<li>Ability to batch download PDFs.</li>
		<li>when searching for someone, can you download all the abstracts (in the background) and not only for the papers  I happened to stand on?</li>
		<li>Ability to associate more than one PDF to an entry.</li>
		<li>Ability to specify the range of dates in hep-(th|ph)/new, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Done</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>(0.98 Now you can assocaite another PDF to an eprint.) PDFs in arxiv, especially the oldest ones, are not good and published versions are preferable; it should be possible to manually set the PDF in such cases.</li>
		<li>(0.92 Now you can check "Replacements" section of daily mailings.) Can you be alerted when new papers are out?  This would very conveniently replace my daily arxiv email.</li>
		<li>(0.92) The possibility to see the bibtex would be very useful.</li>
		<li>(0.92) Say at the bottom how many papers there are.</li>
		<li>(0.92 Now you can set secondary viewer.)Is it possible to have the option to direct PDFs to the browser. This is useful when reading many papers, so that they are all in tabs rather than many windows (e.g. using the Quartz plugin for Firefox)</li>
		<li> (0.9) it would be nice to uniform the "Choose a folder to save PDFs" dialog box to others dialogs present in OSX by allowing a create folder button in the lower left corner.</li>
		<li> (Use <a href="http://www.shadowlab.org/Software/spark.php">Spark</a> or similar software) Can you make a customizable hotkey that makes it appear/disappear.  It would be really cool to make it like an independent widget, given that it's too big for the dashboard.</li>

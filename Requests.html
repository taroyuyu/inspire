	<h1>To be done</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Finding a specific author is sometimes difficult.  In the web-spires I get that list of authors from which I can choose only the relevant ones.  Can we have the same here?</li>
		<li>More control over QuickLook. E.g. it only opens PDF with the system default PDF viewer,  (It would be hard to implement because QuickLook is a system service over which I don't have much control.)</li>
		<li>Ability to batch download PDFs.</li>
		<li>Ability to associate more than one PDF to an entry.</li>
		<li>Ability to specify the range of dates in hep-(th|ph)/new, etc.</li>
		<li>Ability to search arxiv, instead of spires</li>
		<li>Add entries locally</li>
		<li>Multple tabs and/or windows</li>
		<li>Have an option to make the folders on the sidebar physically present on the HDD</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Done</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>(1.1.15)Bibtex integration</li>
		<li>(1.1.14)Ability to check cross-list</li>
		<li>(1.1.14)Stop button should work more reliably. Use spiresâ†’Quit stuck queries as a last resort.</li>
		<li>(1.1.13)Ability to remove local pdf</li>
		<li>(1.1.13) offline mode</li>
		<li>(1.1.13) "Smart list"</li>
		<li>(1.1.13) easily distinguish which entry has pdf locally.</li>
		<li>(1.1.12)Unread/flagged mark</li>
		<li>(1.1 Now you can change the font size of the main article view.) Ability to change the font size.</li>
		<li>(1.1) You can make folders in the sidebar.</li>
		<li>(from when?)Erase some of the entries</li>
		<li>(1.0 It now does.) Quicklook doesn't refresh the file when a new version is downloaded.</li>
		<li>(1.0) Interpret "a A and B" as "a A and a B".</li>
		<li>(1.0) Add "date" to searches.</li>
		<li>(0.98 Now the abstract downloading is more eager; I am putting a cap intentionally not to anger Paul Ginsparg.) when searching for someone, can you download all the abstracts (in the background) and not only for the papers  I happened to stand on?</li>
		<li>(0.98 Now you can assocaite another PDF to an eprint.) PDFs in arxiv, especially the oldest ones, are not good and published versions are preferable; it should be possible to manually set the PDF in such cases.</li>
		<li>(0.92 Now you can check "Replacements" section of daily mailings.) Can you be alerted when new papers are out?  This would very conveniently replace my daily arxiv email.</li>
		<li>(0.92) The possibility to see the bibtex would be very useful.</li>
		<li>(0.92) Say at the bottom how many papers there are.</li>
		<li>(0.92 Now you can set secondary viewer.)Is it possible to have the option to direct PDFs to the browser. This is useful when reading many papers, so that they are all in tabs rather than many windows (e.g. using the Quartz plugin for Firefox)</li>
		<li> (0.9) it would be nice to uniform the "Choose a folder to save PDFs" dialog box to others dialogs present in OSX by allowing a create folder button in the lower left corner.</li>
		<li> (Use <a href="http://www.shadowlab.org/Software/spark.php">Spark</a> or similar software) Can you make a customizable hotkey that makes it appear/disappear.  It would be really cool to make it like an independent widget, given that it's too big for the dashboard.</li>

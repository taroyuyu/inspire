You need to get
	BWToolKit	http://bitbucket.org/bwalkin/bwtoolkit/
	NDAlias		http://homepage.mac.com/nathan_day/pages/source.xml
and put the source files inside BWFramework/, NDAlias/ respectively.
You also need to get
	Sparkle		http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/
and put the Sparkle.framework somewhere.
To open the xib file, you need to register BWTooleKit.ibplugin to the Interface Builder 3.

First build spiresHook plugin, and make the package using spiresHook.pmdoc.
Then you can build the main app.

The source code is not at all commented but it's Cocoa,
so should be more or less understandable.

If you need more info, have some suggestions, or have found some bugs,
please feel free to email me at yujitach@ias.edu.

    <dt>1.6.0 (Jan/6/2015)</dt>

    <dd>Bug fixes for 1.5.1. My sincere thanks go to Jure, Kin-ya, Micha, and as always, Ryo. Dear friends, please do tell me any bugs you found. That would save a lot of your colleagues' time eventually!

	<dd>Now supports the Inspire database as the backend.</dd>
	<dt>1.3.3 (Sep/6/2010)</dt>
	<dd>One bug fix so that you can read today's hep-th. Stricly speaking, the bug is on the arxiv server: the XHTML file it serves states it uses UTF8, but in reality the abstract of an entry was in Latin-1. 
	This confused my app. Alas. (Sep/7: the admin of the arxiv corrected the database itself, so the version 1.3.2 will work. But you're encouraged to update it anyway.)</dd>

	Your one email can improve the lives of ~100 other theorists!</div>
